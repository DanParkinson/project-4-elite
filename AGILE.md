# AGILE

This is where I will document my agile approach. It will be set into phases to help me organise my work. After a few false starts where i found myself getting lost, this will help me document my thoughts. Because of the false starts my README.md has already been created. 

## Phase 1

## Phase 2

With everything set up I am going to style the homepage a litte with bootstrap to allow me to navigate around the website as needed.

With basic stylings in place i can now navigate around the website. I can make any adjustments as nessercary when i am working on other parts.

## Phase 3 

Before creating my reservation model I need users to create accounts. I am going to use Django AllAuth for this.

Users need to be able to:
- create accounts 
- login/ log out
- view account details
- edit account details
- delete account

- navigation bar and homepage buttons should change if user is authenticated.

User Stories:

1, 3, 5, 6, 7

- Now I need users to be able to view their account details, be able to edit them, and delete their account.

User Stories:

8, 9, 10


# fixes

- change password button gap
- navbar drop
- edit details alignment
