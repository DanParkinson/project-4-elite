## Introduction

# Elite Cuisine

Welcome to Elite Cuisine. An artisinal Asian brunch restaurant.

### Scenario

Restaurants perform better with a steady stream of customers. These can be walk-ins or pre booked customers. At it's simplest the booking system could be a phone with pen and paper making notes.

Restaurants are busy places. With staff preparing food, waiting tables and providing outstanding customer care. Taking bookings take up a lot of valuable time for service staff. If the phone rings whilst all servers are busy the phone might not be answered. And a ringing phone can ruin the ambience of a restaurant.

It can help the business if customers use an online booking system instead. This dosen't take up valuable staffs time. Bookings could also be made out of working hours, increasing the accessability to the restaraunt, potentially increasing foot traffic and profits. 

A lot of people also refer a passsive booking system where no human interaction is needed. Meaning a larger clientel.

A business with a well developed website tends to do better than its peers. Customers can gain a better insight of its ethos, facilities and services on offer. In theory this fosters confidence and leads to greater engagement.

With the above in mind, let's create the website!

## UX 

### User Stories

Following an Agile paradigm, user stories will target customer needs and reduce embellishments on the part of the developer. These non technical statements will aid with the incremental changes needed to build the application.

Site user needs can broadly be split into 4 categories or epics:

- Navigation 
- Account Management
- Reservation management
- Other 

#### NAVIGATION
